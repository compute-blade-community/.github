### Pre-Submission Checklist

1. **No Duplicate PRs**
   Search existing pull requests to avoid duplicates.

2. **Branch Naming**
   - Use a descriptive branch name.
   - Branch names must start with `fix/` or `feature/`.
     Examples: `fix/login-bug`, `feature/user-authentication`
     Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard for determining branch prefixes

3. **Commit Style**
   - Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard:

     ```plaintext
     <type>[optional scope]: <description>

     [optional body]

     [optional footer(s)]
     ```

     Examples:
     - `fix(auth): resolve token expiration issue`
     - `feat(docs): add deployment instructions`

4. **Commit Hygiene**
   - Ensure commits are squashed into a single logical commit.
   - The first line of the commit message should be a short, descriptive title.
